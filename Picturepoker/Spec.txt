Highest->lowest rewarding scheme:

5 of a kind: X16
4 of a kind: X8
Full House: X6
3 of a kind: X4
2 pairs: X3
1 pair: X2



A hand contains 5 cards

A card contains:

A string, stating what's the face value
A value between 1 ~ 6, stating its order

Warning: in early dev. will name string as "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", DO NOT simply convert string -> integer
(string will be changed later to Star, Mario, Luigi...)

Star > Mario > Luigi > Flower > Mushroom > Cloud, there's 5 cards of each, so 30 cards in total


A game contains 2 hand, player's hand and A.I.'s hand

A player can bet up to max. 5 coins (might want to override this)

A player may quit the game at anytime by typing "q" or "quit". When this happens game.cc shall produce "lastgame.sav" to the current directory


A .savegame file contains:

Player's name
# of coins the player has left


In event of a tie:

5 of a kind: check the picture
4 of a kind: check the picture
Full House: check the picture WITH THE 3 same (format will be in AAABB, only care about the AAA (impossible for AAA to be tied)) 
3 of a kind: check the picture
2 pairs: check the picture WITH THE HIGHEST ORDER, check the picture WITH THE SECOND HIGHEST ORDER if highest order is tied. If both 2-2 are tie, then it's a tie
1 pair: check the picture




undecided:

what data structure will Hand use (array? vector? linked list?)
need to write the special version of sorting
