Play with a standard 52-card deck

All cards are of its own value(i.e. '2' = 2 points, '3' = 3 points)
J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13

Player and A.I. will both draw 2 cards

The final score is the score of your hand (2 cards) mod 10.
For example, if your hand is KK then it's (13 + 13) % 10 = 6
if your hand is AJ then it's (1 + 11) % 10 = 2
if your hand is 34 then it's (3 + 4) % 10 = 7

You may choose to draw a 3rd card after drawing those 2 cards.

The A.I. may also choose to draw the 3rd card

Whoever have their final score closest to 9 wins the game


AI's rule:

Punto banco: if player drew the 3rd card, the AI's response will be as follows
If Player drew a 2 or 3, Banker draws with 0-4 and stands with 5-7.
If Player drew a 4 or 5, Banker draws with 0-5 and stands with 6-7.
If Player drew a 6 or 7, Banker draws with 0-6 and stands with 7.
If Player drew an 8, Banker draws with 0-2 and stands with 3-7.
If Player drew an ace, 9, 10, or face-card, the Banker draws with 0-3 and stands with 4-7

Implementation: (from AI's standpoint) 
1. check the 3rd card drawn by player
2. check my current hand
3. draw 3rd card if condition matches. Otherwise stay as it is




TO DO: What if player did not draw the 3rd card? (assuming cheat mode is off, player doesn't know that AI's at a disadvantage) Under what condition should AI draw the 3rd card?

TO DO: restrict the card limit: right now it's theoretically possible (although extremely unlikely) to have 6 Kings show up in a game

TO DO: implement a save system (so that you can actually bet and win/lose money)
