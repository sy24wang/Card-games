Note: in real-world Baccarat usually contains up to 8 decks of 52-cards. So theoretically possible (although extremely unlikely) to have 6 Kings show up in a game

Full playing rules are written in function printrule()


AI rules:

if player stayed with 2 cards, then draw if current score is 0-5, stay if 6-7

if player drew the 3rd card, the AI's response will be as follows:

If Player drew a 2 or 3, Banker draws with 0-4 and stands with 5-7.
If Player drew a 4 or 5, Banker draws with 0-5 and stands with 6-7.
If Player drew a 6 or 7, Banker draws with 0-6 and stands with 7.
If Player drew an 8, Banker draws with 0-2 and stands with 3-7.
If Player drew an ace, 9, 10, or face-card, the Banker draws with 0-3 and stands with 4-7

Implementation: (from AI's standpoint) 
1. check the 3rd card drawn by player
2. check my current hand
3. draw 3rd card if condition matches. Otherwise stay


Technical spec:

main (Baccarat.cc) calls Game. Game calls Player. Player calls Card

Note: there are 2 fields in the Card class: 'value' and 'score'. 
'value' is the card's face value stored in string (ex. "J", "10", "7", "K")
'score' is the card's face value stored in int (ex. 0, 10, 2, 3, 7). We treat "J", "Q", "K" as 0 as per game rule


TO DO: implement a save system (so that you can actually bet and win/lose money)
