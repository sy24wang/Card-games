# Card-games

This is a collection of the card games that I've written

Bacarrat:

Each player draws 2 cards and compare the highest last digit sum. For example, a 5 and a 7 is 2; 8 and 9 is 7.
A 10 or a picture (J, Q, K) is 0

After looking over the 2 cards, you may choose to draw a 3rd card

The player with the number closest to 9 wins!

Hanabi: (in progress)

Hanabi is a co-operative card game played by 4 players, everyone will have 5 cards in their hands that is shown only to other players

During a player's turn, he/she can do one of the following:
1. give clues/hints to 1 other player, which costs 1 information token. A game starts off with 8 information tokens
2. discard a card. This replenishes 1 information token
3. play a card. Successfully completing a suit replenishes 1 information token. A fuse token will be consumed if a card is misplayed. A game starts with 3 fuse tokens

There are 5 suits in a Hanabi game: white, yellow, green, blue, and red

Each suit contains three 1s, two 2s, two 3s, two 4s, one 5


The game ends immediately if:
1. All fuse tokens are gone (everyone loses)
2. All 5s have been played successfully (everyone wins)

Otherwise, the game continues for one round after the deck is empty
